through  task  organization  and  support  relationships.  Commanders  allocate  the  employment  of  joint capabilities  to  subordinate  echelons;  integrating  these  capabilities  requires  an  understanding  of  joint processes. The degree to which commanders effectively integrate joint and Army capabilities at all echelons directly influences success during operations.

3-16. Military forces comprise a wide variety of components that leaders must arrange into a coherent and effective whole. Army leaders integrate -

- z Joint capabilities.
- z Multinational, interagency, and interorganizational capabilities.
- z Echelons and staffs.
- z Different types of units to achieve a combined arms approach.
- 3-17. Almost every leader activity, in some way, orients on integrating parts of the force to achieve unity of purpose and unity of effort. There are many intellectual tools leaders use to facilitate integration. Common ones include -
- z The  joint  and  Army  targeting  processes  (which  includes  working  groups,  boards,  and  other activities to help integrate joint intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance [ISR] and fires).
- z Mission analysis to integrate the activities of multiple staff proponents.
- z The nesting  concept  advocated  for  in  the  mission  command  approach  to  C2  that  helps  lower echelons integrate their purpose with higher echelons.
- z Reception,  staging,  onward  movement,  and  integration  (RSOI)  for  new  forces  entering  an operation.
- z Engagement area development to integrate all weapons systems into a defense.

## Synchronization

3-18. Once  leaders  have  integrated  the  right  capabilities,  they  must  synchronize  their  employment  and effects. Synchronization is  the  arrangement  of  military  actions  in  time,  space,  and  purpose  to  produce maximum relative combat power at a decisive place and time (JP 2-0).

- 3-19. Understanding the following factors enables leaders to determine when to initiate employment of a capability and how to adapt to changes in the operational environment during execution:
- z The desired overall effect over time.
- z How the individual effects complement each other over time.
- z The time it takes each capability or formation to generate its individual effects from the start of employment.
- z Whether each individual effect is enduring, simultaneous, or sequenced with the other effects.
- z The consequences of an individual effect not occurring at the planned time.

3-20. Individual effects can be enduring, simultaneous, or sequential. Enduring effects provide a continuous impact on the threat until they are no longer necessary. Enduring effects can have a debilitating effect on enemy forces, but they may require significant resources to sustain. Simultaneity is the execution of related and  mutually  supporting  tasks  at  the  same  time  across  multiple  locations  and  domains  (ADP  3-0). Simultaneous effects, the result of attacking enemy forces in multiple domains at the same time and across the  depth  of  the  enemy's  echelons ,  can  have  a  paralyzing  effect  on  enemy  decision  making  and  the effectiveness of the enemy's most critical systems for a limited period of time .  They can degrade enemy reactions and facilitate the path to eventual culmination and defeat. Sequencing effects against a threat can create successive dilemmas and opportunities for deception when enemy forces begin to expect a pattern.

3-21. Leaders  synchronize  actions  and  effects  through  C2  and  the  operations  process.  The  mission, commander's intent, and concept of operations form the basis for detailed synchronization. Commanders determine the degree of control necessary to synchronize operations. They balance synchronization with agility  and  initiative,  but  they  never  surrender  the  initiative  for  the  sake  of  synchronization.  Excessive synchronization can lead to too much control, which limits the initiative of subordinates and undermines mission command.

## Achieving Convergence

- 3-22. Achieving  convergence  requires  detailed,  centralized  planning  and  mission  orders  that  enable decentralized  execution.  Redundant  and  resilient  communications  enable  synchronized action.  However, leaders must anticipate degraded communications and be prepared to rely on mission orders, accept risk, and make decisions to accomplish the mission. During execution, leaders seek to maintain the conditions of convergence through rapid transitions, adjusting priorities, shifting the main effort, or adapting to maintain momentum. Longer periods of convergence allow for greater opportunities to expand advantages and achieve objectives.
- 3-23. Leaders must understand the various processes for requesting joint capabilities and integrating them with ground maneuver. Air, space, and cyberspace tasking cycles operate on different time horizons and have different  requirements  for  requesting  effects.  These  cycles  may  vary  depending  on  the  theater  and  the situation. Whenever possible, leaders anticipate requirements for these effects during planning and provide ample time for the joint force to generate them. Leaders may request effects on shorter timelines, but they should not make them essential to mission success.
- 3-24. During competition, the theater army establishes conditions for convergence that enable deterrence, provide options during crisis, and enable success at the outset of armed conflict. Intelligence, sustainment, positioning  of  forces,  and  other  activities  to  set  the  theater  facilitate  situational  understanding,  decision making, integration, and synchronization during armed conflict. The theater army requests cyberspace and space effects through the combatant command to ensure there is enough time to integrate and synchronize these capabilities. The theater army balances the use of these capabilities during competition with the need to preserve them for use by Army formations during crisis or armed conflict. When armed conflict occurs in a theater, the theater army continues to facilitate convergence by providing capabilities to the land component command and shaping the operational environment outside the joint operational area.
- 3-25. During  armed  conflict,  the  land  component  command  apportions  joint  capabilities  to  subordinate echelons. Corps integrate joint capabilities with ground maneuver at the appropriate echelon where forces employ them to achieve convergence and achieve objectives.  The advantages provided by maritime, air, space, and cyberspace capabilities will not be available all the time, so tactical echelons must be ready to exploit their effects when generated. (See FM 3-14 for more information on space effects. See FM 3-12 for more information on cyberspace effects.)
- 3-26. Convergence is most effective when its effects accrue and create a cycle of expanding opportunity. Employing  multiple  and  redundant  methods  of  attack  increases  the  probability  of  success  by  avoiding dependence on a single method of detecting, tracking, and attacking. Success causes enemy forces to react and activate more of their capabilities, creating another opportunity in one or more domains. The corps and its subordinate echelons align their operations on land with the opportunities created by the effects generated by the other components of the joint force, preserving combat power to maximize their ability to exploit the opportunities convergence presents.

## ENDURANCE

- 3-27. Endurance is the  ability  to  persevere  over  time  throughout  the  depth  of  an  operational environment. Endurance  enhances  the  ability  to  project  combat  power  and  extends  operational  reach. Endurance is about resilience and preserving combat power while continuing operations for as long as is necessary to achieve the desired outcome. During competition, Army forces improve endurance by setting the theater across all warfighting functions and improving interoperability with allies and other unified action partners.
- 3-28. Endurance reflects the ability to employ combat power anywhere for protracted periods in all conditions, including environments  with  degraded  communications,  chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) contamination, and  high  casualties.  Endurance  stems  from  the  ability  to organize,  protect,  and  sustain  a  force,  regardless  of  the distance  from  its  support  area  and  the  austerity  of  the

Leaders account for the requirement to preserve combat power while sustaining people, systems, and formations over the time and distance necessary throughout the depth of an area of operations.

environment. Endurance involves anticipating requirements and making the most effective and efficient use of resources.

- 3-29. As  forces  fight  through  successive  engagements,  maintaining  mutual  support  among  units  helps prevent  them  becoming  isolated,  being  defeated  in  detail,  and  culminating  early.  Protection  prevents  or mitigates  enemy  effects  and  preserves  combat  power,  postponing  culmination  and  prolonging  effective operations. One way Army forces preserve combat power is by maintaining dispersion to the greatest degree possible. Leaders can mass combat power from dispersed positions and generate the desired effects without concentrating  forces  any  more  than  is  necessary.  During  operations,  commanders  and  staffs  integrate, synchronize, and simultaneously apply protection capabilities.
- 3-30. Leadership and tactics contribute to endurance. Plans that allow for different units to be the main effort using  follow  and  support  or  follow  and  assume  techniques  prevent  early  culmination  in  the  units  first committed to close combat. Realistically determining what tempo friendly forces can maintain given enemy resistance, weather, and physical distances and the impact they have on Soldiers, leaders, and equipment increases endurance over time. Schemes of maneuver that avoid enemy strengths and preserve combat power are less likely to negatively affect morale.
- 3-31. Sustainment  operations  are  essential  to  endurance.  Using  all  methods  for  continuously  delivering sustainment through land, maritime, and air capabilities improves endurance. When possible, sustainment units employ a spaceand cyberspace-enabled communications network to transmit sustainment requirements and coordinate the delivery of materiel or services. However, leaders must anticipate degraded communications and combine analog systems for communication with predictive analysis and disciplined initiative to ensure commanders can maintain acceptable tempo for as long as necessary.

## DEPTH

- 3-32. Depth is the extension of operations in time, space, or purpose to achieve definitive results (ADP 3-0). While the focus of endurance is on friendly combat power, the focus of depth is on enemy locations and dispositions across all domains. Commanders  achieve  depth by understanding the strengths and vulnerabilities of the enemy's echeloned capabilities, then attacking them throughout their dispositions in simultaneous and sequential fashion. Although simultaneous attacks through all domains in depth are not possible  in  every  situation,  leaders  seek  to  expand  their  advantages  and  limit  enemy  opportunities  for sanctuary and regeneration. Leaders describe the depth they can achieve in terms of operational reach.
- 3-33. Operational reach is the distance and duration across which a force can successfully employ military capabilities (JP 3-0). Staffs assess operational reach based on available sustainment, the range of capabilities and formations, and courses of action compared with the intelligence estimates of enemy capabilities and courses of action. This analysis helps the commander understand the limits on friendly operations, the risks inherent in the mission, and likely points in time and space for transitions.
- 3-34. Below the threshold of armed conflict, the theater army creates depth by improving the infrastructure for force projection and by improving interoperability with multinational forces to the degree required by operation plans (OPLANs) and contingency operations. It also adds depth to its operations by expanding influence with allies and partners, populations, and other relevant actors through joint exercises, sustained forward positioning of advisor teams, and forward basing of combat formations.
- 3-35. During  armed  conflict,  the  JFLCC  creates  depth  by  facilitating  access  to  Army  and  other  joint capabilities, especially space and cyberspace capabilities that improve the protection of tactical formations and degrade enemy integrated air defense systems. The JFLCC also requests  that the  JFC influence  the extended deep area in support of land operations. The corps directs fires into its deep area to defeat enemy long-range fires, disrupt enemy sustainment and C2, separate maneuver echelons, and shape the success of future close operations. Special operations forces operating in the extended deep area can detect targets and enable the employment of joint fires to support conventional operations.
- 3-36. Leaders enhance the depth of their operations by orchestrating effects in  one dimension to amplify effects  in  the  others.  For  example,  a  commander  might  decide  to  destroy  an elite  enemy  formation  first because  it  undermines the  confidence  of  the  enemy's other  units.  Commanders  exploit  this  through information activities to reduce the will of other enemy forces to fight.

## IMPERATIVES

- 3-37. Imperatives  are  actions  Army  forces  must  take  to  defeat  enemy  forces  and  achieve  objectives  at acceptable cost. They are informed by the operational environment and the characteristics of the most capable threats Army forces can encounter. Imperatives include -
- z See yourself, see the enemy, and understand the operational environment.
- z Account for being under constant observation and all forms of enemy contact.
- z Create and exploit relative physical, information, and human advantages in pursuit of decision dominance.
- z Make initial contact with the smallest element possible.
- z Impose multiple dilemmas on the enemy.
- z Anticipate, plan, and execute transitions.
- z Designate, weight, and sustain the main effort.
- z Consolidate gains continuously.
- z Understand and manage the effects of operations on units and Soldiers.

## SEE YOURSELF, SEE THE ENEMY, AND UNDERSTAND THE OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT

- 3-38. Commanders visualize operational environments in terms of the factors that are relevant to decision making. Operational environments are dynamic and contain vast amounts of information that can overload C2  systems  and  impede  decision  making.  Commanders  simplify  information  collection,  analysis,  and decision making by focusing on how they see themselves, see the enemy, and understand the operational environment. These three categories of factors are interrelated, and leaders must understand how each one relates to the others in the current context.
- 3-39. As part of the operations process, Army leaders use different methodologies to understand and weigh options. These methodologies include the Army design methodology, the military decision-making process, and the rapid decision-making and synchronization process. Each methodology provides a process that allows commanders and staffs to see themselves, see the enemy, and understand the operational environment. (See ADP 5-0 and FM 5-0 for more information on Army planning methodologies.)

## See Yourself

- 3-40. Commanders  develop  an  understanding  of  their  forces  relative  to  mission  requirements,  enemy capabilities, and impacts from the operational environment. This understanding helps to inform current and potential future advantages relative to enemy forces, allowing staffs to develop and adapt courses of action that exploit advantages and mitigate disadvantages. Commanders and staffs maintain this understanding of their  forces  through  running estimates,  subordinate  commander updates,  and friendly forces information requirements (known as FFIRs): A friendly force information requirement is information the commander and staff  need  to  understand  the  status  of  friendly  force  and  supporting  capabilities  (JP  3-0).  Friendly  force information requirements identify the information the commander considers most important to make critical decisions  during  the  execution  of  operations.  The  operations  officer  manages  friendly  force  information requirements for the commander.
- 3-41. Leaders attempt to see themselves from the enemy perspective, in part by understanding essential elements of friendly information. An essential element of friendly information is a critical aspect of a friendly operation that, if known by a threat would subsequently compromise, lead to failure, or limit success of the operation and therefore should be protected from enemy detection (ADP 6-0).

3-42. Leaders  see  their  formation  in  relation  to  their  mission  and  in  the  broader  context  of  the  higher command,  adjacent  unit,  and  all  domains.  Part  of ' seeing  yourself ' is  understanding  how  land-based operations  enable  operations  in  the  other  domains,  and  how  capabilities  from  all  domains  can  enable operations on land. (See paragraphs 2-66 through 2-67 for a discussion of joint interdependence.)

## See the Enemy

- 3-43. Commanders  see  the  enemy  in  terms  of  its  combat  power,  advantages,  and  intentions  within  the operational environment and broader strategic context. Commanders develop their understanding of enemy forces from their individual knowledge, experience, and judgment honed through self-study, training, and education. From this base of knowledge commanders and staffs build shared understanding of enemy forces and environment through intelligence preparation of the battlefield. Intelligence preparation of the battlefield is the  systematic  process  of  analyzing  the  mission  variables  of  enemy,  terrain,  weather,  and  civil considerations in an area of interest to determine their effect on operations (ATP 2-01.3).
- 3-44. Intelligence preparation of the battlefield provides commanders with awareness of information gaps about  enemy  forces  and  the  operational  environment.  Staffs  translate  these  gaps  into  information requirements  and  assist  the  commander  in  determining  priority  intelligence  requirements.  A priority intelligence  requirement is  t he intelligence component of commander's critical information requirements used to focus the employment of limited intelligence assets and resources against competing demands for intelligence support (JP 2-0). More importantly, priority intelligence requirements (known as PIRs) identify information about the threat and operational environment that a commander considers most important to making  decisions  in  a  specific  context.  Intelligence  about  civil  considerations  may  be  as  critical  as intelligence about enemy forces in some cases. The intelligence officer, in coordination with the rest of the staff, manages priority intelligence requirements for the commander.
- 3-45. Enemy forces attempt to hide from, deceive, disrupt, and deny friendly collection efforts to prevent friendly forces from perceiving the enemy's true intentions. This requires commanders plan to develop the situation  through  action  and  fight  for  information.  Information  collection  operations  may  require  the commander to assume significant risk to determine enemy dispositions and anticipate enemy intentions.
- 3-46. Leaders do not limit their understanding of the enemy to those forces in their assigned area. Enemy forces are capable of employing capabilities from great distances and multiple domains. Leaders must be aware of those capabilities so they can take appropriate action. (See paragraphs 3-75 through 3-79 for more information on making enemy contact.)

## Understand the Operational Environment

- 3-47. Leaders view the operational environment in terms of domains, dimensions, operational variables, and mission variables that are relevant to their decisions. The most difficult aspect of an operational environment to understand is how the different factors interact to affect operations.
- 3-48. Understanding is,  in  the  context of decision making, knowledge that has been synthesized and had judgment applied to comprehend the situation's inner relationships, enable decision makin g, and drive action (ADP  6-0).  Understanding  is  judgment  applied  to  knowledge  in  the  context  of  a  particular  situation. Understanding is knowing enough about a situation to make an informed decision. Judgment is based on experience, expertise, and intuition -and it informs what decision to make.

## Situational Understanding

- 3-49. Successful operations demand timely and effective decisions based on the information available. As such, commanders and staffs seek to build and maintain situational understanding throughout an operation. Situational  understanding is  the  product  of  applying  analysis  and  judgment  to  relevant  information  to determine the relationships among  the operational and mission variables (ADP  6-0). Situational understanding allows commanders to make effective decisions and enables commanders and staffs to assess operations accurately. Commanders and staffs continually strive to maintain their situational understanding and work through periods of uncertainty, accepting that they cannot eliminate them. They train their staffs and subordinates to function in uncertain environments.

## Shared Understanding

3-50. A  critical  challenge  for  commanders,  staffs,  and  unified  action  partners  is  creating  common understanding of an operational environment, an operation's purpos e, its challenges, and the approaches to

solving those problems. Shared understanding of the situation, which requires effective flow of information between echelons, forms the basis for unity of effort and subordinate initiative.

- 3-51. Effective decentralized execution depends on shared understanding. Shared understanding starts with Army doctrine  and  leader  development  that  instill  a  common  approach  to  the  conduct  of  operations,  a common professional language, and a common understanding of the principles of mission command. It is this shared understanding that allows even hastily task-organized units to operate effectively. Commanders and staffs actively create shared understanding throughout the operations process (of planning, preparation, execution, and assessment). They collaboratively frame an operational environment and its problems, and then they visualize approaches to solving those problems. (See ADP 6-0 for a more detailed description of shared understanding.)

## Common Operational Picture

- 3-52. A  common  operational  picture  (COP)  is  key  to  achieving  and  maintaining  shared  situational understanding in all domains and making effective decisions faster than the threat. The common operational picture is  a  display  of  relevant  information  within  a commander's area of interest  tailored  to  the  user's requirements and based on common data and information shared by more than one command (ADP 6-0). Although the COP is ideally a single display, it may include more than one display and information in other forms, such as graphic representations or written reports.
- 3-53. The  COP  facilitates  collaborative  planning  and  helps  commanders  at  all  echelons  achieve  shared situational understanding. The COP must account for relevant factors in domains affecting the operation, and it provides and enables a common understanding of the interrelationships between actions and effects through the physical, information, and human dimensions. Shared situational understanding allows commanders to visualize the effects of their decisions on other elements of the force and the overall operation.
- 3-54. Command posts draw on a common set of shared and relevant information to create a digital COP. Units always maintain an analog COP in the event that the digital COP is compromised. During large-scale combat operations, communications are likely to be degraded or denied during the course of operations. Army forces maintain shared situational understanding by updating physical maps and graphics, and using rehearsed and reliable primary, alternate, contingency, and  emergency (known as PACE) communication plans. Command posts are typically responsible for maintaining the digital and analog COP. Units develop standard operating procedures (known as SOPs), reporting timelines, and battle rhythm events to ensure the COP is accurate, relevant, and current.
- 3-55. The difficulty of maintaining a COP in a multinational environment varies based on training level, language  differences,  level  of  data  sharing,  technical  compatibility  of  systems,  restrictions  based  on classification, and other national caveats. Unified action partners may not have the technical capability or compatible  systems  to  create  and  share  a  digital  COP.  Commanders  must  recognize  and  plan  for  this possibility by using alternate methods, such as liaison officers, messengers, and voice communication.

## ACCOUNT FOR BEING UNDER CONSTANT OBSERVATION AND ALL FORMS OF ENEMY CONTACT

- 3-56. Air,  space,  and  cyberspace  capabilities  increase  the likelihood that threat forces can gain and maintain continuous  visual  and  electromagnetic  contact  with  Army forces. Enemy forces possess a wide range of space-, air-,

That which can be detected can be targeted for attack and killed.

maritime-, and land-based ISR capabilities that can detect U.S. forces. Leaders must assume they are under constant observation from one or more domains and continuously ensure they are not providing lucrative targets for the enemy to attack.

- 3-57. Leaders consider nine forms of contact in multiple domains. They are -
- z Direct:  interactions  from  line-of-sight  weapon  systems  (including  small  arms,  heavy  machine guns, and antitank missiles).
- z Indirect: interactions from non-line-of-sight weapons systems (including cannon artillery, mortars, and rockets).

- z Non-hostile: neutral interactions that may degrade or compromise military operations (including civilians on the battlefield).
- z Obstacle:  interactions  from  friendly,  enemy,  and  natural  obstacles  (including  minefields  and rivers).
- z CBRN: interactions from friendly, enemy, and civilian CBRN effects (including chemical attacks, nuclear attacks, industrial accidents, and toxic or hazardous industrial materials).
- z Aerial:  interactions  from  air-based  combat  platforms  (including  attack  helicopters,  armed unmanned aircraft systems [UASs], air interdiction, and close air support).
- z Visual:  interactions  from  acquisition  via  the  human  eye,  optical,  or  electro-optical  systems (including ground reconnaissance, telescopic, thermal, and infrared sights on weapons and sensor platforms such as unmanned aircraft systems and satellites).
- z Electromagnetic: interactions via systems used to acquire, degrade, or destroy using select portions of the electromagnetic spectrum (including radar, jamming, cyberspace, space, and electromagnetic systems).
- z Influence:  interactions  through  the  information  dimension  intended  to  shape  the  perceptions, behaviors, and decision making of people relative  to  a  policy  or  military  objective  (including through social media, telecommunications, human interaction, and other forms of communication).
- 3-58.  In all contexts, direct, indirect, non-hostile, CBRN, and aerial contacts are sporadic. However, Army forces  are  typically  in  continuous  visual,  electromagnetic,  and  influence  contact  with  adversaries.  Army forces are under persistent visual surveillance by space and other capabilities. Army forces and individuals are in constant electromagnetic contact with adversaries who persistently probe and disrupt individual, group, and Army capabilities dependent on space and cyberspace. Army forces are subject to adversary influence through disinformation campaigns targeting Soldiers and their family and friends through social media and other platforms.
- 3-59. During competition, adversary forces employ multiple methods of collecting on friendly forces to develop an understanding of U.S. capabilities, readiness status, and intentions. They do this in and outside the  continental  United  States.  They  co-opt  civilians  and  employ  space-based  surveillance  platforms  to observe unit training and deployment activities. They also penetrate networks and gain access to individual and group cyberspace personas to create options for future intimidation, coercion, and attack. Soldiers and their families should use telecommunications, the internet, and social media in ways that do not make them or their units vulnerable to adversary surveillance.
- 3-60. During armed conflict, enemy networked land-, maritime-, air-, and space-based capabilities enable threats to detect and rapidly target friendly forces with fires. Forces that are concentrated and static are easy for enemy forces to detect and destroy. Dispersing forces has multiple survivability benefits. It increases opportunities to use cover and concealment to reduce probability of detection. In the event the enemy detects elements of the friendly force, dispersion acts as a form of deception, helping to conceal the intentions of the friendly  force.  Leaders  only concentrate forces  when necessary  and  balance  the  survivability  benefits  of dispersion  with  the  negative  impacts  dispersion  has  on  mission  effectiveness.  In  addition  to  dispersion, leaders integrate and synchronize deception, operations security, and other actions to thwart enemy detection efforts. (See JP 3-13.3 and ATP 3-13.3 for detailed information on operations security. See FM 3-13.4 for more information on deception.)
- 3-61. Command  posts  are  extremely  vulnerable  to  detection  from  air  and  space,  as  well  as  in  the electromagnetic spectrum. Army forces must ensure their command posts are difficult to detect, dispersed to prevent a single strike from destroying more than one node, and rapidly displaceable. Once a command post is detected it has only a few minutes to displace far enough to avoid enemy indirect fire effects.  Leaders should focus command posts on the minimum functions necessary to retain their mobility and do everything possible  to  avoid  detection.  When  the  risk  of  enemy  fires  is  high,  commanders  consider  making  their operations more decentralized, dispersing command post nodes into smaller component nodes, and greater dispersion of electromagnetic signatures. Use of existing hardened structures and restrictive terrain to conceal headquarters  equipment  and  vehicles,  instead  of  tents  organized  in  standard  configurations,  are  options commanders have to improve command post survivability.

## Account for Constant Enemy Observation

3-62. Enemy forces  possess  a  wide  range  of  space-,  air-,  maritime-,  and  land-based  reconnaissance  and surveillance  capabilities  that  can  detect  U.S.  forces.  To  counter  these  robust  and  persistent  capabilities requires counterintelligence efforts and the disciplined application of operations security.

3-63. Enemy forces employ UASs in large numbers and with a diverse array of capabilities. Leaders account for enemy capabilities and likely reconnaissance objectives as they develop their counter-UAS plan. Leaders implement  techniques  and  procedures  for  countering  enemy  UASs  based  on  their  organic  capabilities, attached capabilities, and the mission variables.

- 3-64. Leaders combine multiple measures, including deception, to make it more difficult for enemy forces to detect friendly forces. These measures include -
- z Counterreconnaissance, including counter-UAS operations.
- z Cover and concealment, both natural and manmade.
- z False battle positions and deception obstacles.
- z Obscuration.
- z Dispersion.
- z Noise and light discipline.
- z Limited visibility operations, particularly for sustainment functions and large unit movements.
- z Electromagnetic emission control and masking, to include social media and personal communication discipline.
- 3-65. Because Army forces employ an increasing number of capabilities that emit electromagnetic radiation that enemies can target, leaders must apply emission control measures, balancing the risks to the force with the risks to the mission. As risk to the force increases, leaders increase their emission control measures. There may be times that the risk of friendly emissions being detected and targeted is assessed as too high, causing Army forces to use methods of communications with no electromagnetic signature. Understanding threat systems, their capabilities, and their disposition supports effective planning and the execution of emission control measures including -
- z Minimizing length and frequency of radio transmissions.
- z Dispersing formations and command posts.
- z Using lowest effective power settings.
- z Establishing and enforcing the primary, alternate, contingency, and emergency communication plan.
- z Using remote antennas.
- z Using brevity codes, pro-word execution matrices, and communications windows.
- z Using secure landlines.
- z Using directional antennas.
- z Using data-burst transmissions.
- z Using proper encryption and equipment configuration.
- z Moving command posts and formations.
- z Masking emissions using terrain and manmade structures.
- z Recognizing and reporting jamming  of Global Positioning System, radar, and satellite communications.
- z Employing deceptive emitters.

## Implementing Dispersion

3-66. Leader efforts to preempt and mitigate enemy detection are essential, but they cannot eliminate the risk of  enemy  massed  and  precision  fires,  including  CBRN  and  weapons  of  mass  destruction.  To  improve survivability from enemy indirect fires, Army forces maintain dispersion and remain as mobile as possible to  avoid  presenting  themselves  as  lucrative  targets  to  the enemy's most capable systems. When mission

demands require units to remain static for more than short periods of time, those units must dig in to increase survivability. (See ATP 3-37.34 for information on survivability positions.)

3-67. Commanders have options for achieving dispersion. At the operational level, commanders maintain dispersion by employing multiple staging areas and multiple lines of communications. At the tactical level, commanders maintain dispersion by increasing the distance between subordinate formations and among the elements in those formations. In the attack, they use multiple routes and longer march intervals between formations to the objective and only concentrate forces enough to mass effects or generate favorable force ratios during close combat. In the defense, forces occupy areas away from prepared defensive positions until contact is imminent to prevent their detection and destruction by enemy deep fires. Defending forces also maximize dispersion by using terrain and employing the maximum supporting ranges and distances within acceptable risk criteria.

3-68. When concentrating forces is unavoidable or necessary, units remain concentrated at the lowest level and for the shortest time possible and then rapidly disperse. When the desired level of dispersion is not achievable, commanders place greater emphasis on imposing multiple, simultaneous dilemmas on enemy forces as  they move within range of enemy weapons systems. This can reduce the risk of enemy forces efficiently massing their effects. Commanders also use speed and violence of action when dispersion is not possible to minimize exposure in high-risk areas.

## Second Nagorno Karabakh War: September -November 2020

During the six-week war, Azerbaijan exploited its technological advantage with lethal efficiency  against  Armenian  forces.  Azerbaijan  used  its  UASs,  in  conjunction  with Israeli loiter munitions and modified old Soviet AN2 planes, to defeat Armenia's older air  defense  systems.  Azerbaijani  forces  flew  the  remotely  piloted  AN-2s  to  trigger engagements from Armenia's air defense systems, while Azerbaijan's UASs and loiter munitions  remained  at  higher  altitudes  undetected  or  out  of  range.  When  the  air defense  systems  engaged  targets,  Azerbaijan  pinpointed  the  air  defense  systems locations and destroyed those systems with UASs, loiter munitions, or indirect fires. Azerbaijan's tactics caused Armenia's air defense network to collapse, and Azerbaijan gained local air superiority over the battlefield.

With air superiority, Azerbaijan placed Armenian forces under continuous surveillance with its UASs. In addition, Azerbaijani forces had infiltrated special operations forces to conduct surveillance of Armenian positions. Armenian forces were unable to remain hidden, and Azerbaijan began destroying Armenian tanks, artillery, and vehicles at a significant rate. Although battle damage assessments vary, multiple sources reported that  Azerbaijan  destroyed  hundreds  of  Armenian  tanks,  armored  fighting  vehicles, artillery  systems,  multiple  launch  rocket  systems,  and  air  defense  systems.  The inability to hide and fear of destruction had a demoralizing effect on Armenian soldiers.

## CREATE AND EXPLOIT RELATIVE PHYSICAL, INFORMATION, AND HUMAN ADVANTAGES IN PURSUIT OF DECISION DOMINANCE

3-69. The  employment  of  lethal  force  is  based  on  the  premise  that  destruction  and  other  physical consequences compels enemy forces to change their decision making and behavior, ultimately accepting defeat. The type, amount, and ways in which lethal force compels enemy forces varies, and this depends heavily on enemy forces, their capabilities, goals, and the will of relevant populations. Understanding the relationship between physical, information, and human factors enables leaders to take advantage of every opportunity and limit the negative effects of undesirable and unintended consequences.

3-70. Actions taken focused on one dimension can create advantages in the other dimensions. The physical dimension  dominates  tactical  actions  and  the  employment  of  destructive  force  to  compel  an  outcome. Physical actions, particularly the employment of violence, usually generate cognitive effects in the human

dimension. Information dimension factors inform and reflect the interaction between human and physical factors. The information dimension deals with how relevant actors and populations communicate what is happening in the physical and human dimensions.  The human dimension is where perceptions, decision making, and behavior is determined, and is therefore the dimension that ultimately determines human will. Commanders combine, reinforce, and exploit advantages through all the dimensions, expanding them as they accrue over time. (See Chapter 1 for more information about physical, information, and human advantages.)

- 3-71. During competition and crisis, Army forces set conditions for armed conflict and physically exhibit combat  readiness  through  training  and  exercises  which  is  communicated  by  various  means  to  create  a deterrent effect in the human dimension. During armed conflict, tactical leaders typically focus on generating physical  advantages  and  the  immediate  physical  and  cognitive  effects  they  produce.  However,  leaders maintain  awareness  of  the  overall  purpose  of  physical  effects,  ensuring  they  commit  combat  power  to necessary objectives that produce advantageous results in all dimensions. At the strategic level, leaders focus more  heavily  on  the  information  and  human  impacts  of  physical  effects  and  how  to  convert  them  into desirable policy outcomes.
- 3-72. Successful  military  operations  often  depend  on  a  commander's  ability  to  gain  and  maintain  the operational initiative by achieving decision dominance -a desired state in which a force generates decisions, counters  threat  information  warfare  capabilities,  strengthens  friendly  morale  and  will,  and  affects  threat decision making more effectively than the opponent. Decision dominance requires developing a variety of information  advantages  relative  to  that  of  the  threat  and  then  exploiting  those  advantages  to  achieve objectives. Commanders employ relevant military capabilities from all warfighting functions to create and exploit decision dominance.
- 3-73. Decision dominance is aspirational, situationally dependent, and always relative to an opponent. The goal is to understand, decide, and act faster and more effectively than the threat. It is not absolute speed that matters, but speed relative to the threat. Commanders can achieve this by interfering with an enemy force's C2 while enhancing, protecting,  and  sustaining  their  own C2.  An advantage need  not be  large. A small advantage exploited repeatedly can contribute decisively to the success of Army forces. The ability and desire to generate a higher tempo does not mean commanders should act when the situation calls for waiting. The aim is meaningful -not merely rapid -action. A decision to act is meaningful only if the resulting actions by friendly forces create an advantage relative to the threat.
- 3-74. Adversaries and enemies pursue their own relative advantages, typically in asymmetric ways, while continually attempting to achieve decision dominance over friendly forces. Because threat forces adapt, and situations evolve, decision dominance is relative and transitory. Commanders therefore continuously make assessments to determine which forms of relative advantage are most important to pursue over time.

## MAKE INITIAL CONTACT WITH THE SMALLEST ELEMENT POSSIBLE

- 3-75. Army forces are extremely vulnerable when they do not sufficiently understand the disposition  of enemy forces and become decisively engaged on terms favorable to enemy forces. To avoid being surprised and incurring heavy losses, leaders must set conditions for making enemy contact on terms favorable to the friendly force. They anticipate when and where to make enemy contact, the probability and impact of making enemy contact, and actions to take on contact. Quickly applying multiple capabilities against enemy forces while preventing the bulk of the friendly force from being engaged itself requires an understanding of the forms of contact.
- 3-76. During armed conflict at the tactical level, development of situational understanding, and

commanders  seek  to  gain  and  maintain  contact  with  the enemy using the  smallest  element  possible,  enabling  rapid using maneuver  and  fires  to  attack  enemy  forces  in  the  most Units seek to make contact using sensors or  unmanned  systems  first  to  minimize risk to Soldiers and key capabilities.

advantageous way. Judicious employment of all available reconnaissance and security capabilities is the most effective way to make direct contact with the smallest possible friendly force. Friendly forces should attempt to  make  contact  with  sensors  and  unmanned  systems  first,  incorporating  them  into  their  movement techniques. Employment of UAS and other platforms activates enemy systems and enables their detection without creating risks to manned friendly reconnaissance and maneuver forces. After detecting an enemy

capability, Army forces cue intelligence platforms from other domains to improve their understanding of enemy force dispositions and engage those forces on advantageous terms.

- 3-77. Identifying enemy locations may not provide enough information for Army forces to discern enemy intentions. Commanders develop the situation through action when they deliberately place forces in contact. Small maneuver forces are often the most effective way to compel enemy forces to  react and show their intentions. Leaders exercise tactical patience and set conditions for success. They synchronize maneuver with complementary and reinforcing capabilities through  the depth of an operational environment to generate situational  awareness  and  detect  opportunities  to  exploit.  By  combining  friendly  speed  with  multiple dilemmas, it is possible to rapidly disintegrate the coherence of an enemy formation before it can effectively respond.
- 3-78. Using capabilities from multiple domains, such as air and ground, commanders cause threat systems to  activate  or  emit  electromagnetic signals  that reveal their capabilities and the locations  of their  critical nodes, such as sensors, shooters, and command posts. During competition, commanders and staffs use this information to improve understanding, update target lists, and refine plans for attacking threat vulnerabilities. By doing this, commanders and staffs set conditions for success during armed conflict.
- 3-79. There are situations in which it is not advisable to make contact with the smallest possible element. When commanders are confident they have superior forces, have the element of surprise, and know the enemy's disposition and course of action,  they  make  contact  with  as  much  combat power  as possible to maximize surprise and shock effect against enemy forces.

## IMPOSE MULTIPLE DILEMMAS ON THE ENEMY

- 3-80. Imposing multiple dilemmas on enemy forces complicates their decision making and forces them to prioritize among competing options. It is a way of seizing the initiative and making enemy forces react to friendly  operations.  Simultaneous  operations  encompassing  multiple  domains -conducted  in  depth  and supported  by  deception -present  enemy  forces  with  multiple  dilemmas.  Employing  capabilities  from multiple domains degrades enemy freedom of action, reduces enemy flexibility and endurance, and disrupts enemy plans and coordination. The application of capabilities in complementary and reinforcing ways creates more problems than an enemy commander can solve, which erodes both enemy effectiveness and the will to fight.
- 3-81. Deception contributes to creating multiple dilemmas, achieving operational surprise, and maintaining the initiative. Deception efforts by tactical formations seek to delay enemy decision making until it is too late to matter, or to cause an enemy commander to make the wrong decision. Deception requires an understanding of how to surprise enemy forces; time to plan, prepare, execute, and assess a deception operation; and the ability to properly resource the deception effort.
- 3-82. Deception inhibits effective enemy action by increasing the time, space, and resources necessary to understand  friendly  courses  of  action.  Well-executed  deception  begins  a  cumulative  effect  on  enemy decision-making cycles, and it can cause inaction, delay, misallocation of forces, and surprise as enemy forces react to multiple real and false dilemmas. Attempts to mislead enemy forces are fundamental to all courses of action development wherever possible. While commanders and staffs integrate deception as part of course of action development, they take operations security measures to obscure friendly intentions, make enemy forces account for multiple friendly courses of action for as long as possible, and ensure that enemy forces do not become aware of the deception effort. (See JP 3-13.4 and FM 3-13.4 for more information on military deception.)
- 3-83. Forcible  entry  operations  and  envelopments  into  locations  offset  from  how  enemy  defenses  are oriented  can  create  multiple  dilemmas  by  dislocating  enemy  forces'  prepared  operational  approach  or exceeding their capability to respond. The capability to project power across operational distances presents enemy forces  with  difficult  decisions  about  how  to  array  their  forces  in  time  and  space.  Rapid  tactical maneuver  to  exploit  a  penetration  or  envelopment  defeats  enemy  attempts  to  reposition  integrated  fires networks or integrated air defense systems, which in turn are typically less effective when moving.
- 3-84. Creating  multiple  dilemmas  requires  recognizing  exploitable  opportunities.  Understanding  enemy dispositions,  systems,  and  vulnerabilities,  and  the  characteristics  of  the  terrain  and  population,  informs
